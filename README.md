# Oil-Price-Prediction-using-ML
This is machine learning project for predicting oil prices by using LSTM  model.
The project was built on google colab using pyhton. 

Main goal was to crate a predictive model which will determine the accuracy of prediction of the oil prices using RMSE score (Root mean squared error).

LSTM model or Long Short Term Memory is used for predicting the prices.
